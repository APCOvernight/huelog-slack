Template [HueStatus](https://github.com/APCOvernight/huestatus/) module

## Get Started

- Clone or Fork this Repo
- Add your desired module name, version, git repo, author etc to package.json
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Make sure [HueStatus](https://github.com/APCOvernight/huestatus/) is installed globally `npm install -g huestatus`

## Building your module

The entry point for this module is index.js. It must export a class that extends the [BaseModule class from HueStatus](https://github.com/APCOvernight/huestatus/blob/master/src/Module.js).

Your module class must have a `start` method. This is called when the module is loaded and HueStatus is ready to start updating.

Your module class can optionally have a `generateInstanceName` method, that generates a unique instanceName for use in debugging. If this method is omitted a uuid will be generated instead.

The BaseModule constructor adds the module config object to `this.config`. It also creates an event emitter at `this.emitter` but you shouldn't have to access this directly. You should use the change method (see below).  Configuration is read from the `.heurc` file, typically located in your home directory.

### this.change(status, message) â‡’ <code>async function</code>
The BaseModule change method is used to update the status (by emitting an event to the huestatus module).

**Returns**: <code>Promise</code>

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | <code>String</code> | The status to send to the Hue Light - One of '*ok*', '*alert*', '*warning*', '*working*' |
| message | <code>String</code> | Message to send to the debug log. (Why is the status changing?) |

**Example**
```js
if (someConditionIsMet) {
  await this.change('ok', 'everything is ok')
}

```

## Testing

The default codestyle in this repository is [APC-style](https://github.com/APCOvernight/apc-style).  Run `npm run lint` to lint all js files in your project.

Unit tests based on [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) are included in the `test` folder. Run these with `npm run test` command. Test coverage is calculated using [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc).

[Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.github.io/) mutation tests can be run with `npm run stryker`

### Running in your local environment

Run `npm link` ([docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)) from the project directory, to make it available to node globally. Then you can register it in your .huerc and run `huestatus` to test it manually.

## Integrations

A .travis.yml file is included for simple [Continuous Integration in Travis](https://travis-ci.org). You will need to add your repo to travis to set up automated builds.

The npm coverage script is set up to send coverage to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) and [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) upon build. You will need to create an account and add your repositories there for this to work.

## Publishing

Make sure to write your own `README.md`, and to replace all references in `package.json` to your new module name. 

You should include a `.huerc-example` file with an example of all the possible module config variables.

When you are ready, publish to NPM with `npm publish`.
